<h1>Arduboy Toolset</h1>

<p>
    Arduboy toolset lets you upload + backup <b>sketches</b>, <b>flashcart data</b>, and <b>EEPROM</b>.
    There's a rudimentary <b>.arduboy</b> package creator with basic fields, and a separate <b>Cart Editor</b> 
    you can open from the <u>File</u> menu.
</p>

<h2>Sketches</h2>

<p>
    Sketches are compiled singular programs, usually with a <b>.hex</b> extension. Sometimes a hex file will
    be embedded inside a <b>.zip</b> or <b>.arduboy</b> file. All three are accepted for upload to Arduboy.
    Note that Arduboy can only hold one sketch at a time, so uploading will overwrite whatever is currently
    there. 
</p>

<p>
    Some sketches use data stored on the "Fx" flash memory. These games usually go on a flashcart, so this 
    option is only used while developing FX games. It places the development FX data at the end of the
    flash memory, so you don't have to reflash an entire flashcart.
</p>

<p>
    The rest of the options on sketch upload are for special patches. They are not necessary if you have a
    regular Arduboy, they are mostly for DIY hardware.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> sketch backups you make are raw .bin files, which have to be turned back into .hex
    files before they can be reflashed. There's currently no way to do this yet, sorry! In the future,
    flash backups will be .hex files by default.
</p>

<h2>Flashcart</h2>

<p>
    Arduboy FX and others with the "Fx modchip" have a special bootloader that boots before the sketch
    to allow you to choose one of many games on the additional flash memory (usually 16MB). The bootloader 
    will flash the game you choose to the "sketch" area and boot into it, just like this tool does 
    when you upload a sketch.
</p>

<p> 
    You can generate flashcart <b>.bin</b> files by using the 
    <a href="http://www.bloggingadeadhorse.com/cart/Cart.html">Cart Builder</a> website. The bin
    file you download from there can be directly flashed to your Arduboy using the Flashcart upload 
    portion of this tool
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively, you can use the <b>Cart Editor</b> located in the <u>File</u> menu. This lets you
    pull the FX flashcart off your device, make edits, and reflash it, but it also lets you create new
    flashcarts and save them to the filesystem, in the same .bin format used for flashing.
</p>

<h2>EEPROM</h2>

<p>
    EEPROM is a small 1024 byte area made specifically for save game data. All games have to share the 
    same space for saves, so they often overwrite each other. You can backup + restore this data
    using this tool
</p>

<h2>Package</h2>

<p>
    Arduboy games are generally distributed in a <b>.arduboy</b> file format. It's a simple zip archive 
    with the extension renamed, containing the game, extra data, images, and information about the game.
</p>

<p>
    You can generate <b>.arduboy</b> archives for distribution using this package generator. You 
    can also modify existing packages (such as updating the version + binaries inside).
</p>

<p>
    Note that this package generator does not have the complete set of fields supported by the 
    <b>.arduboy</b> format, but it is enough for most use cases. However, if you open a package
    which contains these extra fields, they will <b>not</b> be saved back when you save the 
    package. Use this package creator with caution. More fields may become available in the future.
</p>

<p>
    <b>This package generator uses an updated .arduboy format from 2023</b>, which was agreed upon 
    by the community at that time. All parts of the toolset will read this format (v4) and all older 
    ones, but it will only <b>write</b> v4 packages. Some older/unmaintained tools may not be 
    compatible with this format.
</p>

<h2>Image</h2>

<p>
    To use images in Arduboy (such as sprites), they must be converted into code or FX data. This
    utility lets you convert images to C++ code, either directly or saved as a <b>.h</b> file. It also
    lets you generate a .bin file for use in fx data, though you must merge it with other FX data 
    on your own.
</p>

<p>
    The arduboy library doesn't distinguish between images and tilesheets; they are both stored in a contiguous
    array with the width + height stored as the first 2 elements. However, the data is rearranged for tilesheets
    so each tile is stored one after the other, while images are stored fully continuously (it ends up as the 
    same amount of data, just different orders).
</p>

<p>
    You can enable tiling of the image using the controls on the right of the pane. The image displayed on the 
    left is a preview to help you see where the tiles line up. Spacing, if used, is removed from the data.
</p>

<p>
    Mask generation is controlled manually rather than automatically, so you can always know if mask data
    is being generated. Mask data increases the size of the data, and you must indicate to the Arduboy library
    that you are utilizing masks. The transparency data in the image is used to generate the mask (if selected),
    even if no transparency exists.
</p>

<h3>Image Caveats</h3>

<ul>
    <li>If no tiling is set, the entire image will be used</li>
    <li>Stored width/height is based on individual tilesize (which is entire image size if no tiling set)</li>
    <li>Tile sizes must be 1 byte each (up to 255x255) if generating code, but can be 2 bytes each (up to 65535x65535) if exporting to FX data</li>
    <li>When mask is used, it defaults to "interleaving" the mask with the image data, which is usable with the Arduboy call "drawPlusMask"</li>
    <li>"Separate mask" is <b>only</b> for code generation. You'll get a warning if it's set for FX data generation, as FX images only support "No mask" or "PlusMask"</li>
    <li>Currently, the threshold for "black" is &lt; 64 in the green channel. The same threshold is used for transparency (if generating mask), transparent is alpha &lt; 64</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternate image converters</h3>

<p>This tool is meant as a simple image converter with some oft-used features. There are more robust tools.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Pharap/ABSpriteEditor">ABSpriteEditor</a> by Pharap is a robust sprite editor 
    all-in-one that can also convert to code. If you're looking to make sprites for Arduboy, I recommend this one.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.bloggingadeadhorse.com/TeamARGImgConverter/">TeamARGImgConverter</a> by the defunct 
    TeamARG is a basic image converter with similar features to the ones in this toolset. It is hosted by 
    Filmote, as TeamARG no longer exists. You may find examples on the forums for using this image converter;
    if they're still using the old dead links, know that it is hosted at the link above now.
